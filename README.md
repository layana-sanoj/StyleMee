### Project Description
StyleMe is a web app where users share outfit photos and get feedback through simple polls. It includes a blur tool so users can hide parts of their images for privacy. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and Firebase for authentication, storage, and database.

### The Problem statement
Many people struggle to get quick and honest outfit feedback while also maintaining privacy when sharing their photos online.

### The Solution
StyleMe solves this by giving users a space to share outfit photos and get quick feedback through polls. It includes a blur tool so users can hide parts of their images and protect their privacy. This way, users can confidently ask for style opinions without oversharing personal details.
